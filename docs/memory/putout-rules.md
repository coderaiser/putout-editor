# Writing a putout rule here

**What the rules in `packages/plugin-putout-editor` taught me**, kept because it is reusable and
not because a problem is open. The open ones are in
[`../issues/putout-plugins.md`](../issues/putout-plugins.md).

## Report-only is possible, at the cost of one no-op action

A plugin needs one of `find`, `traverse`, `replace`, `include`, `exclude`, `rules`, `declare` or
`scan` for the loader to recognise it, and a `find` with no `fix` throws in the normal runner.
`check-match` in `@putout/plugin-putout` is a replacer whose `replace` maps the pattern **to
itself**. The two filesystem rules do the same and their tests assert the file comes back byte
for byte — choosing which token a colour becomes is a human decision.

## A putout rule can see comments

`parse` does not drop them. They are not nodes and `types.isComment` does not exist, but
`leadingComments`, `trailingComments` and `innerComments` are on the AST, so a `traverse` over
the declarations and a `push` per entry sees every one:

```js
export const traverse = ({push}) => ({
    VariableDeclaration: (path) => {
        for (const key of KEYS) {
            const comments = path.node[key] || [];
            
            comments.map(() => push({
                path,
                key,
            }));
        }
    },
});
```

`fix` empties the array it was handed, and the printer reprints without them. So "no comments
in a rule" is `remove-comments`, a rule, running under `putout .` with the rest. The
`scripts/check-comments.js` it replaces was a second gate in a second language over the same
files, and its coverage `exclude` still named the directory it no longer has.
